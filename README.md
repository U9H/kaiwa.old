# Kaiwa

Kaiwa is an opinionated, self-hosted, and simple commenting system.  It's meant for static sites & created with Rust.  It uses containers and is meant to be run on cheap servers.

## Inspiration

## Usage

You'll need `docker` and `docker-compose`.  **Note to windows users: Please don't do that.  I'm trying to dev on windows, and it sucks.  Just get a VM or something.**

```
docker-compose run api
```

## API endpoints
TBD

## What will be implemented
- [ ] Multiple domain support
- [ ] Question / Arbitrary comment data
- [ ] Per-page threads
- [ ] Spam mitigation
